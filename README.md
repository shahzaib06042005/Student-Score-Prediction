# ðŸŽ“ Student Score Prediction

This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship, where I built a simple Linear Regression model to predict a student's exam score based on the number of study hours.

## ðŸ“Œ Task Description

- Predict student exam scores based on the number of study hours.
- Dataset used: *Student Performance Factors* (sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/))
- Goal: Build and evaluate a regression model to estimate exam scores.

## ðŸ§ª Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Checked for null/missing values
- Verified datatypes and dataset shape

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the relationship between study hours and exam scores
- Created scatter plots and histograms to understand distributions

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 split)
- Normalized and prepared features for regression

### 4. Model Building
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`
- Visualized the regression line over data

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Calculated **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **RÂ² Score**
- Compared predicted vs actual scores using line plots

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- The model found a strong positive correlation between study hours and scores
- High RÂ² score indicating a good fit for this simple dataset
